# cobol-is-fun
This repo houses small COBOL applications that can be used to learn COBOL if you don't already know it, or learn new features that you haven't seen before if you do.

# json-parse
This simple COBOL application demonstrates how to parse JSON using IBM Enterprise COBOL.  It is written to work in a standalone fashion so it can run without any input files.  The JSON string is declared in memory, as are the resuts from the parse, and everything is printed out for clarity.
